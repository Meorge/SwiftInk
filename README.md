# SwiftInk

**SwiftInk** is, as the name suggests, a Swift port of the runtime engine
for the [ink scripting language](https://github.com/inkle/ink) by [inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com).

Currently, the goal is for it to be as close to a 1:1 port of the original
C# engine as possible - this means using the same object types, variable names,
and so on. Once the port is working, I hope to begin making the API more Swift-friendly.

**For now, it should be assumed to be unstable!**

## Documentation
Until a first version is complete, the code for SwiftInk will follow the C# engine
very closely. This means that the official [Running Your Ink](https://github.com/inkle/ink/blob/master/Documentation/RunningYourInk.md)
documentation from inkle should be easily translatable into SwiftInk's API.

## License
Like the original ink engine, SwiftInk is available under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md).
